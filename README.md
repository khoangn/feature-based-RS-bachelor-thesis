There are two Recommender Systems in this project: item-based RS and feature-based RS.

The systems run with Eclipse JEE on a Tomcat Server and is connected to a PostgreSQL Database.

1. In order to run the systems, first install and setup a Tomcat Server.
2. Create a PostgreSQL Database and import the database.sql file.
3. Then import the project to eclipse.
4. The link of the systems: http://localhost:8080/com.bachelor/
5. To switch the system after login, you can go to:
   http://localhost:8080/com.bachelor/home for the feature-based RS or
   http://localhost:8080/com.bachelor/home_item_based for the item-based RS.

P.S. in feature-based-RS-bachelor-thesis/com.bachelor/src/com/bachelor/myUtils/DatabaseConnector.java you can edit the Database name and password.
